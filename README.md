# GardenPy #

**GardenPy** is a machine learning library coded from **scratch** (**NumPy** and **Pandas**).
Other than **GardenPy**, this repository includes demos utilizing the machine learning library, including **MNIST**'s handwritten numbers.
While **GardenPy** isn't faster than **PyTorch** and doesn't have GPU utilization, building a model from **GardenPy** follows the mathematical format of a model.

## Features
- **Automatic differentiation** with vectors, matrices, and tensors.
- **Machine learning algorithms**, including initialization algorithms, activation functions, loss/cost functions, and optimization techniques.
- **DataLoaders** for loading datasets.
- **Visualization functions** for results.
- **Pre-built models** utilizing the **GardenPy** library, including a dense/fully-connected neural network (DNN or FNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- **Pre-built models** utilizing **PyTorch** following the same format as the models utilizing the **GardenPy** library for comparisons.
- **Pre-written training scripts** for certain datasets, including **MNIST**'s hand-drawn number dataset.
- **Pre-trained models for certain** datasets, including **MNIST**'s hand-drawn number dataset.
- **Drawing scripts** utilizing trained models for recognizing user-drawn numbers utilizing **PyGame**.

## Usage

### Demo Usage
This repository includes pre-trained models and pre-written training scripts.

#### Training
To train a model, simply run the *train.py* file included under the folder for each type of model under each dataset.
Data will automatically generate after running the *train.py* script if the data doesn't exist.

#### Drawing

To run a drawing script, simply run the *draw.py* script located under each dataset's training folder.
It should be noted that not every dataset has a drawing script.

(todo: image)

To change what type of model is used in the drawing script, choose a model from the list of models.
```python
# todo
```

### Basic Usage
Though **GardenPy**'s pre-built models are simple to use, they allow for significant customization.
Pre-built models will include default settings that make utilizing them fast and simple.

```python
# todo
```

Refer to Documentation(#documentation) for in-depth documentation for using **GardenPy**'s pre-built models.

### Advanced Usage
**GardenPy**'s machine-learning library allows building models that, when written, read like mathematical notation for that model.

Here is a comparison between a simple **GardenPy** model and its mathematical notation.
